# Ngoc-Linh Nguyen — Analytical & Research Portfolio

My name is Ngoc-Linh Nguyen. I hold a strong analytical background in Microeconomics and have developed practical skills in data wrangling, regression analysis (using R and Python), and economic research design through various research assistant positions. Additionally, I have experience in qualitative research methods, including conducting field interviews and performing textual analysis using NVivo. I am eager to apply my technical and research capabilities to the field of economic research—particularly in a Research Assistant role or an entry-level analytical position focused on data analysis.

This GitHub repository is a curated collection of my work and experiences, demonstrating my technical, analytical, and research capabilities.
